**Welcome Tea Session for PSG Members of Secondary One and Two Students (21 May 2022)**&nbsp;

  

&nbsp;A welcome tea session was held for PSG members of Secondary One and Two students. Mdm Rekha, teacher-in-charge of PSG, opened the session by welcoming them.

  

Our principal, Ms Tham shared with the PSG members the school’s direction. This enabled them to better understand how the school programmes support the development of Riversidians into future-ready learners.  

The EXCO shared the activities that the PSG members had been involved in and the upcoming events for 2022. Through the activities facilitated by the PSG EXCO, parents not only learned more about the school they also connected and bonded with one another.
