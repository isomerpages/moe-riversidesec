Our Concert Band took part in the Singapore International Band Festival 2022 under the guidance of our new band director, Mr Teo Kay Min. This was their first performance in 2022. Our band director and members worked hard to put together two songs, Cedar River Celebration and Little Suites for Band. They definitely took away valuable lessons and precious memories were formed as they worked hard together to put up a spectacular performance.
