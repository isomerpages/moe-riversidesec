#### Key events and achievements

<u>National Day Concert</u><br>
Our school’s National Day Concert this year was our very first live performance in two years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. A week leading to the National Day concert, our choristers performed the morning mash-up of five iconic National Day songs to enliven the celebratory mood.

<u>Performance at the FAM K @ North West CDC</u><br>
Our choristers also believe in sharing joy through singing and performing for others. On 27 August, our choristers performed for the elderly at the FAM K @ North West CDC and also befriended them by interacting and playing games with them.

<u>The Voices of Singapore Festival</u><br>
Our choristers took part in The Voices of Singapore Festival, Singapore's largest non-competitive choral festival. The festival aims to create meaningful choral music-making experiences for all its participants and performers. Our choristers had fun performing at the historical CHIJMES Hall and also got the chance to listen to and learn from other school choirs.

<u>Music Video Production</u><br>
Our choristers embarked on a music video production. They were divided into three groups and each group had to develop a concept and storyboard based on the song given. They were strongly encouraged to look up other successful videos as sources of inspiration to make a successful video of their own. This gave them the opportunity to think creatively whilst honing their craft.
