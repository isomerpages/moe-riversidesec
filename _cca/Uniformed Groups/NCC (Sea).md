#### Aims

National Cadet Corps (NCC) (Sea) aims to:  <br>
1 \.  Nurture inspiring leaders and committed citizens through fun, adventurous and military-related activities; and<br>
2 \.  Serve the needs of our school and our various stakeholders.

#### Key events and achievements

<u>Kayaking and Dragon Boat Activities</u><br>
Our cadets participated in various outdoor physical activities this year. These included the 1-Star Kayaking Course to equip cadets with kayaking proficiency and water confidence. The 2022 Pesta Sukan Dragonboat Competition also forged a spirit of tenacity and teamwork among them.

<u>Army Open House 2022</u><br>
Our cadets also attended the Army Open House 2022 to better understand the mission and capabilities of the Singapore Army and participated in a sea tour by the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore to aid their learning of seamanship. Our commitment to our cadetsâ€™ learning through innovative practices was recognised this year when we received Distinction for the 2022 NCC HQ Unit Recognition assessment.
