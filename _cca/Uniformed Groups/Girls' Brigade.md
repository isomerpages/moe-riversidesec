#### Key events and achievements

<u>Dr Low Guat Tin (LGT) Challenge 2022</u><br>
A key event Girls’ Brigade (GB) participated in this year was the ‘Better Together, for a Better Tomorrow’ Dr Low Guat Tin (LGT) Challenge 2022.This biennial event is organised by GB Headquarters. This year, our Secondary 2 and 3 girls participated in this competition in teams. One of our teams clinched the prestigious Silver Award at this National Competition which involved all primary and secondary Girls’ Brigade companies in Singapore.

<u>Career Exploration programme</u><br>
Our girls participated in the Career Exploration Programme by the “The Astronauts Collective” (TAC). TAC is a collective of 350 volunteers from diverse education and career pathways. They have worked with more than 6000 youths and helped them explore and discover meaningful careers. Astronauts is used as a metaphor for youths who are exploring the vast world of work. Through this programme, our girls embarked on their journey to explore and find meaningful careers. The girls had the opportunity to interact with professionals during the Career Human Library.
