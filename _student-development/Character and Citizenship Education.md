CHARACTER AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION
===================================

  
Character and Citizenship Education at Riverside aims to develop students of good character who are guided by the school values, RS SPIRIT. Through the learning of social emotional skills, we seek to nurture resilient students. Students also grow to become active contributors to the community and nation, and develop the skills and attitudes to navigate future educational and career paths.     
 
CCE content covers the following areas:  
1.      Cyber Wellness  
2.      Education and Career Guidance  
3.      Family Education  
4.      Mental Health  
5.      National Education (NE)  
6.      Sexuality Education  
  

  
The learning of CCE takes place in weekly CCE lessons and is also integrated into school-wide experiences like CCAs and NE commemorative days. The learning is further supported by a caring and enabling school environment that is built on positive teacher-student relationships, and strong peer support and relationships.
