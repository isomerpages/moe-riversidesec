The Riverside Integrated Skills Experience (RISE) programme creates opportunities to ignite students’ joy of learning and deepen their learning in an exciting, experiential and meaningful way. RISE aims to provide authentic experiences through place-based and technology-infused learning. As students acquired and integrated knowledge and skills in different settings and across different disciplines, they also learnt about the importance of teamwork and collaboration, and developed their individual sense of self-reliance and determination.
