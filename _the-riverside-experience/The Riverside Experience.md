    <td class="tg-baqh">It is exciting to have my own iPad for the first time. Though I initially struggled with learning its different functions, the SLS lessons taught me about the various functions of the iPad and I learned to use my iPad effectively. I am now able to use my iPad to plan my time and complete my work before the end of the day. I also managed to create a movie for the Student-initiated Learning (SIL) on my iPad. I hope I will be able to learn more functions on the iPad to enhance my learning! - Mabel</td>

    <td class="tg-baqh">I vividly remember being a bright-eyed junior student councillor, watching in awe as the then Student Council EXCO took their pledge as student leaders. Then, I did not understand the true meaning of student leadership. Now, I discovered that leadership is more than just being a role model for fellow schoolmates. It is also about guiding my peers to reach their fullest potential and doing what is right. I could have never been more honoured and humbled to hold the role as student council president. My journey as a student leader is definitely not a perfect one but I hope that I have inspired my peers to achieve their best and more. - Nurienne</td>

    <td class="tg-baqh">What I like about ALP is that I can learn what is happening in the world and our society. Through the programme, I get to research and discover what is being done globally and locally for issues such as climate change. I hope to learn more about the partnership between countries to tackle these issues together. I also find learning the 17 UN goals useful as it helps me to think deeply about how I can contribute to improve the world I live in. - Saw Jia Hui</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">My experiences with various arts events in school have been extremely enjoyable. I really enjoyed working behind the scenes for the song we recorded to publicise RSGT, and also the process of recording an original song for the annual SYF Youth Station. Thanks to the support from my friends and teachers, I can now muster the courage to pursue my passion for the arts, to improve myself and of course, to chase my dreams. - Ho Xin Hui</td>
    <td class="tg-baqh">One thing I like about RISE is that it helped me to understand myself better and to get out of my comfort zone- to play my part in the community. I also made new friends from my new form class and I was also able to improve my leadership skills. The RISE experience made me realise that I am capable of more things and how to be a better leader. - Naimi Irdina</td>
