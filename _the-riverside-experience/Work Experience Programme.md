WORK EXPERIENCE PROGRAMME
=========================



The Work Experience Programme (WEP) at Riverside provides opportunities for our upper secondary students to experience working in organisations such as S.E.A. Aquarium, Singapore Zoo, Novotel Singapore on Stevens, Rolla Video Production Company and The Little Things, a cooking school for pre-schoolers. These internships offer invaluable insight to our students, as they explore their interests and aspirations, and gain an understanding of the nature and demands of work life.
