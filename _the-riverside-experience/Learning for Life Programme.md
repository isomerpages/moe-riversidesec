Riversideâ€™s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Arts for Life, is designed to bring out the artist in every Riversidian. Through multiple levels of programmes catered to a whole variety of arts interests, our students are able to appreciate as well as learn to express themselves through the arts.  
  

Our Secondary 1 students experience a series of modules that immerse them in Multi-Ethnic Dance, Digital Photography as well as Digital Song Arrangement, while Secondary 2 students develop their communication skills and gain confidence, through the Speech and Drama module. Through an assortment of drama tools such as improvisation and role play, students explore a variety of speaking contexts.

Outside the classroom, Riverside's Got Talent is an arts talent competition where students get the opportunity to showcase their talents in categories such as singing, photography and visual arts.
