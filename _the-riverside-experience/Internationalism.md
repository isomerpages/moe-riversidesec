INTERNATIONALISATION
====================

  

Riverside Secondary offers a range of internationalisation experiences for our students, which develop their global awareness and cross-cultural skills. In recent years, our students have gone on trips to China, Korea, India, Vietnam and Brunei, to name a few. These locations guided by the larger shift in the global economic centre of gravity towards Asia, and the experiences are geared towards preparing our students to engage with Asia in their future higher education and work life.
