## School Crest

style="width:32%">

The blue ‘C’ on the left denotes the school as a caring community in a challenging learning environment nurturing the total development of the Riversidian.
   
The red circle represents the focal point of the school which is the all-round development of the Riversidian in leadership, aesthetics, meta-cognitive, physical, social and moral aspects.


As the Riversidian journeys through his years in the school, he will imbibe values and lifeskills that will impel him to leap forward and embrace the global challenges of tomorrow.
