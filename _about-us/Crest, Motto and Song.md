# CREST, MOTTO AND SONG

### School Crest

![School Crest](/images/School%20Crest.png)

The blue ‘C’ on the left denotes the school as a caring community in a challenging learning environment nurturing the total development of the Riversidian.
   
The red circle represents the focal point of the school which is the all-round development of the Riversidian in leadership, aesthetics, meta-cognitive, physical, social and moral aspects.


As the Riversidian journeys through his years in the school, he will imbibe values and lifeskills that will impel him to leap forward and embrace the global challenges of tomorrow.

### School Motto

## My Best and More

### School Song

### My Best and More

*Lyrics by O. J. Balasingam, Music by Adeline Wong*

In the north where the waters ride high  
Stands a school where spirits never die  
Committed to build a community  
One heart, one mind, one destiny

My best and more,  
Believing in our hearts and will  
My best and more,  
Striving until time stands still

Riverside, far as the eye can see  
Making dreams turn into reality  
Together in perfect harmony  
One will, one road, one eternity

My best and more,  
Believing in our hearts and will  
My best and more,  
Striving until time stands still
