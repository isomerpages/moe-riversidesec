To safeguard the well-being of all students and staff, starting from **19 May 2021, Wednesday** all schools will shift to full Home-based Learning (HBL) until the end of Term 2. Parents are encouraged to keep their children at home during this period where possible.

  

During the June holidays starting 30 May 2021, graduating cohorts may return to school in small groups where necessary. The mid-year GCE O-level Mother Tongue Language examinations will proceed as planned with strict Safe Management Measures in place.
