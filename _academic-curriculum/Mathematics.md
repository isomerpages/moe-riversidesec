MATHEMATICS
===========

The Mathematics department aims to deepen our students’ passion and to develop a positive attitude towards the subject. We provide them the experience of making learning relevant to “Live Maths, Love Maths”.          

The approach to the teaching and learning of Mathematics involves:  
1.       Learning concepts through the use of manipulatives, peer-to-peer collaborations and mathematical discourse;
2.      Developing process and using Polya's four-step method to solve problems; and  
3.       Inculcating positive attitudes, confidence and appreciation towards mathematics               

####   Key Programmes  
  
**Crime Scene Investigation (C.S.I.)**  
Students work collaboratively to solve a case by applying scientific and mathematical concepts.  

**Math Trail**  
Students actively demonstrate skills such as reasoning, analysis, data collection and making connections to better appreciate mathematics and hone their thinking, listening and communication skills.  

**Competitions**  
Selected students participate in the Mathematics Olympiad and Normal Course Mathematics Competition.
