PHYSICAL EDUCATION
==================
The Physical Education department aims to equip every student with skills and knowledge, anchored on good values to be physically competent in enjoying a lifetime of healthy living safely.  
  

The approach to the teaching and learning of Physical Education includes:  
1.       practising a variety of psychomotor skills to understand the movement of their body as whole and in parts;
2.         adopting a games-centered approach through modified games to motivate participation and promote 
 exploration of strategies for sports conceptual learning; and
3.       creating a positive environment for collaboration and competition within the class or level to provide feedback on experiential learning and the acquisition of relevant knowledge, skills and values.   

#### Key Programmes  
  

**Sports Carnival**  
All students compete in inter-class games to put into practice sport skills acquired over eight weeks of lessons. By playing against peers from other classes and levels, they experience the importance of teamwork and sportsmanship. Through the Sports Carnival, students cultivate resilience and the determination to strive for excellence in all they do.  

**Outdoor Learning Programme**  
Students are equipped with basic knowledge and practice on orienteering, map reading, tent pitching and injury management during Outdoor Education (OE) modules. The 3-day 2-night Adventure Camp for Secondary 3 students complements the knowledge and skills acquired in the OE modules, as students go through a series of rope courses and obstacle challenges as a class. Through the Outdoor Learning Programme, students grow to be more resilient, rugged and adaptable.
