MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES
=======================

  
The Mother Tongue Languages department aims to instil in our students a sense of pride in their unique culture, strengthen values and develop a strong sense of belonging to Singapore through the study of their Mother Tongue.  
  

The approach to the teaching and learning of Mother Tongue Languages involves:  
1.      adopting a variety of pedagogies to engage and excite students;  
2.      providing enrichment modules for extensive and deepening of learning; and  
3.      communicating standardized assessment criteria and providing meaningful feedback to improve students' learning experiences
