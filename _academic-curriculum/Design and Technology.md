DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
=====================


The Design and Technology unit aims to develop independent students who are able to appreciate aesthetics and culture, and translate their knowledge to be creative and innovative problem solvers.  
  

The approach to the teaching and learning of Design and Technology is focused on:  
1.      creating awareness and interest in design (lower secondary)  
2.      inculcating creativity and an innovative spirit (upper secondary)

####  Key Programmes  
  

**Lower Secondary**  
Students complete four artefacts by applying their knowledge and/ or skills of elements in the design process, basic 3D sketching and basic making skills. 

<br>

**Upper Secondary**  
Students generate a model or prototype for an identified area of need, guided by a rigorous design process and advanced workshop process skills.
